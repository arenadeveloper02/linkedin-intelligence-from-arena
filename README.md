## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Database

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local development
2. Set `DATABASE_URL` to your Postgres connection string
3. Run `npx prisma db push` before `npm run dev` if tables are missing

On Vercel, `DATABASE_URL` is injected when Neon is connected to the project.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start the development server
- `npm run build` — production build (runs Prisma generate/push when configured)
- `npm run start` — run the production server locally

## Deploy

This project is intended for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Connect the GitHub repository and deploy the `main` branch.
